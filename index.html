				<h2>I.T Interests</h2>
				<p> My interest in IT is mainly hardware and data, the hardware part stemed from my interest of making/updating my friend's PCs. They know some things about computers but haven't built one, except me so I get to build their systems. Data part
					was from my cousin who is a IT graduate and was actually the reason that I am doing this course. He was explaining to me about his work and stuff about data and it peaked my interest.
				</p>
				<p>
					The reason I chose RMIT was because the IT course is said to be really good, and I'm pretty sick of travelling to St.Albans.
				</p>
				<p>
					I expect to learn anything that is related to technology we have today like software development, data, networking, etc.

				<h2>My Qualifications</h2>
				<p> I don't have any qualifications what so ever of data analysis or data migration. I also have no experience regarding to working in that field of work. I might have some traits like working under pressure and working in a team but other
					than that, nothing much really. </p>
				<h2 class="major">What do I do to get that job?</h2>
				<p> Honestly I don't really have a concrete idea or plan to get to my ideal job. I just have to finish my degree and apply units that center around data analysis, data migration and cloud data. After that, maybe find an internship or a job at
					a small company that deals with data protection or data analysis.</p>

				<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
				<p>s To sum up all of my personality traits, I've used the Myers-Briggs, Big-5 personality test and a learning style test. To sum it all up, I'm a:
					<un>
						<li> Myers-Briggs: Campaigner (ENFP-T)</li>
						<li> Big-5 personality: O-C-A-N (Openness, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Neuroticism)</li>
						<li> Learning style: a tactile learner</li>
				</p>
				<p> The results show that I'm a hands-on learners so in order for me to learn things, I have to try the things I've been told to learn by hand. Whether I get it right or make a lot of mistakes, it will be the most efficient way for me to
					learn. From the Myers-Briggs test, I am omniverted so I like to be very social and am able to express my thoughts and ideas but at the same time, I like things that are comfortable and at times like to spend time alone to relax or get work
					done. Apparently I am charming (which I don't think I am at all), Independent, energetic and compassionate. From the Big-5 personality test I have a tendency to feel negative emotions (stress, anxiety, sadness, fear, guilt and shame), which
					is very true but I can bounce back off my feet and have hope. I am also am able to co-operate with others very well and put others first before myself.(which is probably why I have neuroticism)
				</p>
				<p> Based on the test, I would most-likely be a type of person in a team that everyone likes cause I can co-operate with the majority of my team members. To adapt or learn while working in a team I will be trying many things out but also can
					cause mistakes which can make me feel a bit stressed but I'll still try until I produce the best work I can from trial and error. When something is wrong with the project I try to keep composure and co-operate with my team on how to solve
					the problem and what measures we can do to have it not occur again.</p>
				<p> When forming a team, I should be aware of their experiences and abilities so I can adapt and learn from them while not being a hinderance when I try new things which may not be a conventional method. I also need to take account on their
					level of communication, I thrive better in a team when everyone is communicating and there are no work-related politics that may hinder a team member's co-operation to the project and the team. The team's learning and working syle should be
					hands-on so we all can learn and are not afraid to try things out, even if we make a mistake or there are problems with out project. </p>

				<h2>Project Plan</h2>
				<h3> Overview</h3>
				<p><font size="3"> My project is an app which shows different configurations and options of computers which will be for gaming. The app will also present step-by-step instructions on how to build a PC containing videos and graphics to help first-time builders. The configurations will show the cost, part name and location of where the parts can be bought. As well as daily updates on deals for those particular parts from Australian stores. Its parts can also be changed to cater to the users if they want to upgrade or downgrade its performance. The configurations will also present different performance diagrams and tables which helps users compare other configurations and their different advantages.
 </p>
 <h3> Motivation</h3>
 <p><font size="3"> People who are seeking to build and buy their first computer do a lot of research of many different parts, configurations and prices because of its their first computer and want it to last for many years until the next iteration of new generations of hardware. They will also go to youtube and watch computer building creators like LinusTechTips, Jay2Cents, etc so they can build their first computer from the parts they’ve bought. They’ve spent so much time on research that it can span over days or weeks in planning before they feel that they’re comfortable to do it, or they may not even be comfortable at all. Having an app like this cuts time and encourages users to get hands-on with their computers.

				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p> The project will consist of 3 major parts: computer configurations and builds, how-to videos and community forums.
					The page will consist of 3 different configurations for the user to choose from:
<ul>
<li>Gaming</li>
<li>Build-your-own</li>
<li>How-to</li>
<li>Community</li>
</ul>

The 'Gaming' will have 3 standard configurations for the users to view: budget, mid-tier, and high-tier. Budget will cater to users who will play e-sports titles (CS-GO, Dota 2, LOL, Rocket League, etc) and some old AAA games. The cost of the budget configuration will be $750. Mid-tier is for users who will comfortably play AAA games at medium-high settings and easily run e-sports titles. The cost of the mid-tier configuration will be $1500. High-tier is for users who want to play their games at ultra setting and more such as rendering. The cost of the high-tier will be $2500.
All of the configurations will be updated constantly due to the different parts being cheaper.

					<div class="content">
						<p> Build-your-own allows users to build their own system on the app. It has categories for parts (example hard drives & SSDs) and are subcategories by what type of part they want (example 2.5’ drives or 3.5’ drives). All of the parts will have all of the costs listed from different Australian outlets supplying the parts. On completion, the PC configuration will display different averages of FPS of e-sports titles and AAA games and can compare different builds if the user decides on a part they want to change.

						<p> How-to provides topics of how to build a computer and troubleshoot a computer, which contains short and sharp instructions, graphics and a video for each topic. The ‘build-a-computer’ contains subcategories of different parts  and users choose which parts they have as users may or may not have a particular part. It is difficult to have one video that can cater to any build as every system is different. By doing this, it makes it much easier and efficient way to find what you need. The ‘troubleshooting-a-computer’ shows users how to troubleshoot a computer which includes: overclocking, installing OEMs, raid, network connection set-up, etc. There is also a list in the topics that contain further information such as why that error occurs and how it occurs. </p>

						<h3>Description</h3>
						<p> Community allows users to discuss different topics and threads, they could be:
		<ul>
		<li>Community builds</li>
		<li>Help forum</li>
		<li>Community discussion</li>
		<li>FAQ</li>
		<li>Bugs & glitches</li>
		<li>Patch news</li>
		</ul>

		The reason why to have a community forum is it allows users to connect and speak to other users that may have a question or problem they need an answer to. It also allows users to voice out any bugs, glitches or ideas for the app which could potentially improve it. The forums are checked by admins to regulate the posts that may go against the terms and service which can include inappropriate use, bullying etc.

						<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p> For the app to be created, I need an app creation software such as Adobe XD and Android Studio that allows me to create the app and build the interface with the help of UX consultants. Of course money because the app needs to be R&D prototyped, tested, experimented and advertised.</p>
<h3>Skills Required</h3>
<p>The list of skills to build the app:
	<ul>
<li>Proficiency in app development software (android and IOS)</li>
<li>UX development</li>
<li>Computer proficiency</li>
<li>Knowledge and experience of experimentation and feedback</li>
<li>Phones to test the app</li>

These are just scratching the surface of the skills needed to build the app.

		<h2>Outcome</h2>
		<p> The outcome would be that the user will now have a hub on their phone which helps users with computers and how to build them. It will also cut their research time greatly hopefully as there are already different configurations and community configurations that’ll give them information and help with their part choice. The app’s goal is to educate and encourage users of technology, specifically computers now that we are at an era where technology is everywhere and it can be quite a handful for some users. Hopefully that would be the impact of the app.
