									<h2 class="major">I.T Interests</h2>
									<p>
									My interest in IT is mainly hardware and data, the hardware part stemed from my interest of making/updating my friend's PCs. They know some things about computers but haven't built one, except me so I get to build their systems. Data part was from my cousin who is a IT graduate and was actually the reason that I am doing this course. He was explaining to me about his work and stuff about data and it peaked my interest.
									</p>
									<p>
									The reason I chose RMIT was because the IT course is said to be really good, and I'm pretty sick of travelling to St.Albans.
									</p>
									<p>
									I expect to learn anything that is related to technology we have today like software development, data, networking, etc.

									<h2 class="major">My qualifications</h2>
									<p> <font size="2">I don't have any qualifications what so ever of data analysis or data migration. I also have no experience regarding to working in that field of work. I might have some traits like working under pressure and working in a team but other than that, nothing much really. </p>
									<h2 class="major">What do I do to get that job?</h2>
									<p><font size="2"> Honestly I don't really have a concrete idea or plan to get to my ideal job. I just have to finish my degree and apply units that center around data analysis, data migration and cloud data. After that, maybe find an internship or a job at a small company that deals with data protection or data analysis.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Personal Profile</h2>
									<p>s To sum up all of my personality traits, I've used the Myers-Briggs, Big-5 personality test and a learning style test. To sum it all up, I'm a:
									<un>
										<li> Myers-Briggs: Campaigner (ENFP-T)</li>
										<li> Big-5 personality: O-C-A-N (Openness, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Neuroticism)</li>
										<li> Learning style: a tactile learner</li>
									</un>
									</p>
									<p> The results show that I'm a hands-on learners so in order for me to learn things, I have to try the things I've been told to learn by hand. Whether I get it right or make a lot of mistakes, it will be the most efficient way for me to learn. From the Myers-Briggs test, I am omniverted so I like to be very social and am able to express my thoughts and ideas but at the same time, I like things that are comfortable and at times like to spend time alone to relax or get work done. Apparently I am charming (which I don't think I am at all), Independent, energetic and compassionate. From the Big-5 personality test I have a tendency to feel negative emotions (stress, anxiety, sadness, fear, guilt and shame), which is very true but I can bounce back off my feet and have hope. I am also am able to co-operate with others very well and put others first before myself.(which is probably why I have neuroticism)

									<h3 class="major">In a team</h3>
									<p> Based on the test, I would most-likely be a type of person in a team that everyone likes cause I can co-operate with the majority of my team members. To adapt or learn while working in a team I will be trying many things out but also can cause mistakes which can make me feel a bit stressed but I'll still try until I produce the best work I can from trial and error. When something is wrong with the project I try to keep composure and co-operate with my team on how to solve the problem and what measures we can do to have it not occur again.</p>
									<p> When forming a team, I should be aware of their experiences and abilities so I can adapt and learn from them while not being a hinderance when I try new things which may not be a conventional method. I also need to take account on their level of communication, I thrive better in a team when everyone is communicating and there are no work-related politics that may hinder a team member's co-operation to the project and the team. The team's learning and working syle would be hands-on so we all can learn and are not afraid to try things out, even if we make a mistake or there are problems with out project. </p>
