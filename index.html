				<h2>I.T Interests</h2>
				<p> My interest in IT is mainly hardware and data, the hardware part stemed from my interest of making/updating my friend's PCs. They know some things about computers but haven't built one, except me so I get to build their systems. Data part
					was from my cousin who is a IT graduate and was actually the reason that I am doing this course. He was explaining to me about his work and stuff about data and it peaked my interest.
				</p>
				<p>
					The reason I chose RMIT was because the IT course is said to be really good, and I'm pretty sick of travelling to St.Albans.
				</p>
				<p>
					I expect to learn anything that is related to technology we have today like software development, data, networking, etc.

				This job deals with data, data integrity and data migration which really peaked my interest as it's one of my interest in the IT course. The salary is also fairly high which really appeals to me. </p>

				<h2>My Qualifications</h2>
				<p> I don't have any qualifications what so ever of data analysis or data migration. I also have no experience regarding to working in that field of work. I might have some traits like working under pressure and working in a team but other
					than that, nothing much really. </p>
				<h2 class="major">What do I do to get that job?</h2>
				<p> Honestly I don't really have a concrete idea or plan to get to my ideal job. I just have to finish my degree and apply units that center around data analysis, data migration and cloud data. After that, maybe find an internship or a job at
					a small company that deals with data protection or data analysis.</p>

				<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
				<p>s To sum up all of my personality traits, I've used the Myers-Briggs, Big-5 personality test and a learning style test. To sum it all up, I'm a:
					<un>
						<li> Myers-Briggs: Campaigner (ENFP-T)</li>
						<li> Big-5 personality: O-C-A-N (Openness, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Neuroticism)</li>
						<li> Learning style: a tactile learner</li>
				</p>
				<p> The results show that I'm a hands-on learners so in order for me to learn things, I have to try the things I've been told to learn by hand. Whether I get it right or make a lot of mistakes, it will be the most efficient way for me to
					learn. From the Myers-Briggs test, I am omniverted so I like to be very social and am able to express my thoughts and ideas but at the same time, I like things that are comfortable and at times like to spend time alone to relax or get work
					done. Apparently I am charming (which I don't think I am at all), Independent, energetic and compassionate. From the Big-5 personality test I have a tendency to feel negative emotions (stress, anxiety, sadness, fear, guilt and shame), which
					is very true but I can bounce back off my feet and have hope. I am also am able to co-operate with others very well and put others first before myself.(which is probably why I have neuroticism)
				</p>
				<p> Based on the test, I would most-likely be a type of person in a team that everyone likes cause I can co-operate with the majority of my team members. To adapt or learn while working in a team I will be trying many things out but also can
					cause mistakes which can make me feel a bit stressed but I'll still try until I produce the best work I can from trial and error. When something is wrong with the project I try to keep composure and co-operate with my team on how to solve
					the problem and what measures we can do to have it not occur again.</p>
				<p> When forming a team, I should be aware of their experiences and abilities so I can adapt and learn from them while not being a hinderance when I try new things which may not be a conventional method. I also need to take account on their
					level of communication, I thrive better in a team when everyone is communicating and there are no work-related politics that may hinder a team member's co-operation to the project and the team. The team's learning and working syle should be
					hands-on so we all can learn and are not afraid to try things out, even if we make a mistake or there are problems with out project. </p>
